# Guardian Analytics - Fixes Applied

## Issue #1: Blue Buttons Disappearing ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Blue buttons (like "Add New Dataset", "Invite Researcher") were invisible until highlighted.

**Root Cause:** The `bg-primary` Tailwind class wasn't being recognized properly by Tailwind v4.

**Solution:** 
- Replaced all `bg-primary` with explicit `bg-blue-700` color
- Added `shadow-md` to make buttons more prominent
- Changed hover state from `hover:bg-blue-700` to `hover:bg-blue-800`

**Files Updated:**
- `src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` - "Add New Dataset" button
- `src/pages/ResearcherManagement.jsx` - "Invite Researcher" and "Send Invitation" buttons
- `src/pages/ActivityLog.jsx` - "Export Report" button
- `src/pages/ProjectDashboard.jsx` - "New Project Request" and "Open Workspace" buttons
- `src/components/admin/DatasetCard.jsx` - "Manage Access" button
- `src/components/analyst/QueryComposer.jsx` - "Run Private Query" button
- `src/components/analyst/ResultsPanel.jsx` - "Download Result" button

**Result:** All blue buttons now have proper contrast and are clearly visible!

## Issue #2: Navigation Not Highlighting Selected Page ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Top navigation items (Datasets/Researchers/Activity Log) didn't show which page was active.

**Root Cause:** No active state styling was implemented.

**Solution:**
- Added `useLocation` hook from React Router to detect current route
- Created custom `NavLink` component with active state detection
- Applied visual indicators when a nav item is active:
  - **Blue background**: `bg-blue-100`
  - **Blue text**: `text-blue-700`
  - **Bottom border**: `border-b-2 border-blue-700`
  - **Font weight**: `font-medium`

**Active State Styling:**
```javascript
active
  ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 border-b-2 border-blue-700'
  : 'text-gray-700 hover:text-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-50'
```

**Files Updated:**
- `src/components/layout/MainLayout.jsx`

**Result:** Active navigation items now clearly show which page you're on with multiple visual indicators!

## Issue #3: No Easy Way to Switch Between Admin & Analyst ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Users had to manually edit code in `App.jsx` to switch between admin and analyst views.

**Root Cause:** User role was hardcoded in the App component.

**Solution:**
- Moved user role to Zustand global state store
- Added dropdown menu in header with role switcher
- Users can now click their profile in the top-right corner
- Dropdown shows:
  - "Admin View" option (with shield icon)
  - "Analyst View" option (with user icon)
  - Checkmark (✓) next to current role
  - Helper text explaining the feature

**Features Added:**
- Click outside to close dropdown
- Visual feedback showing current role
- Smooth page reload after role switch
- Persistent state management

**Files Updated:**
- `src/components/layout/MainLayout.jsx` - Added dropdown menu
- `src/App.jsx` - Uses store instead of hardcoded role
- `src/store/useStore.js` - Already had `userRole` and `setUserRole`

**How to Use:**
1. Click on user profile in top-right corner
2. Select "Admin View" or "Analyst View"
3. Page automatically reloads with new role
4. Navigation updates to show appropriate menu items

**Result:** Easy role switching with just 2 clicks - no code editing required!

## Developer Notes

- **Active Background**: `bg-blue-100`
- **Active Text**: `text-blue-700`

### State Management
The app now uses Zustand for the user role:

const { userRole, setUserRole } = useStore();
```

### Navigation Active Detection
```javascript
const isActive = (path) => {
  if (path === '/' && location.pathname === '/') return true;
  if (path !== '/' && location.pathname.startsWith(path)) return true;
  return false;
};
```
