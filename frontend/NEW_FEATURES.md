# New Features Added

## âœ… Feature 1: CSV Dataset Upload

### What Was Added
The "Add New Dataset" button in the Admin Dashboard now opens a fully functional upload modal that allows admins to upload CSV files to the backend.

### How It Works

1. **Click "Add New Dataset"** button on the Admin Dashboard
2. **Upload Modal Opens** with:
   - Drag-and-drop upload area
   - Click-to-browse functionality
   - File validation (CSV only)
   - File size display
   - Upload guidelines

3. **Upload Process**:
   - Select a CSV file
   - File is validated (must be .csv)
   - Click "Upload Dataset" button
   - File is sent to backend `/upload` endpoint
   - Shows loading spinner during upload
   - Success message appears when complete
   - Modal auto-closes after 2 seconds

### Technical Details

**Endpoint:** `POST /upload` (configurable via `VITE_API_URL` env var)
- Default: `http://localhost:8000/upload`
- Accepts: `multipart/form-data` with file field

**File Requirements:**
- Format: CSV only
- Max size: 100MB
- First row should contain headers

**Features:**
- âœ… File validation
- âœ… Error handling with user-friendly messages
- âœ… Loading states
- âœ… Success confirmation
- âœ… Cancel functionality
- âœ… File preview (name and size)
- âœ… Remove selected file option

### Code Location
- File: `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`
- Lines: 1-270
- Uses: axios for HTTP requests, FormData for file upload

### Environment Configuration
Set your backend URL in `.env`:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## âœ… Feature 2: Clear Visual Distinction Between Admin & Researcher Views

### What Was Added
Added prominent banner at the top of every page that clearly shows which role view you're currently in.

### Visual Indicators

#### Admin View
- **Color:** Blue gradient (`blue-700` to `blue-900`)
- **Text:** "Admin Dashboard"
- **Description:** "Manage datasets, researchers, and privacy budgets"
- **Icon:** Varies by page (Database, Users, Activity)

#### Researcher View
- **Color:** Teal gradient (`teal-600` to `teal-800`)
- **Text:** "Researcher Workspace"
- **Description:** "Query datasets with differential privacy guarantees"
- **Icon:** Database or Activity

### Where Applied
Banners added to all pages:

**Admin Pages:**
- âœ… Dataset Management (`AdminDashboard.jsx`)
- âœ… Researcher Management (`ResearcherManagement.jsx`)
- âœ… Activity Log (`ActivityLog.jsx`)

**Researcher Pages:**
- âœ… My Projects (`ProjectDashboard.jsx`)
- âœ… Analyst Workspace (`AnalystWorkspace.jsx`)

### Design Details

**Banner Structure:**
```jsx
<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-[color] text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg mb-6">
  <div>Current View</div>
  <div>[Role Name]</div>
  <div>[Description]</div>
</div>
```

**Colors:**
- Admin: Deep Blue - Represents authority, management, control
- Researcher: Teal - Represents data analysis, research, discovery

## How to Test

### Testing CSV Upload

1. **Start your backend server** (must have `/upload` endpoint)
2. Switch to **Admin View** (click user profile â†’ Admin View)
3. Click **"Add New Dataset"** button
4. Click the upload area or drag a CSV file
5. Verify file appears with name and size
6. Click **"Upload Dataset"**
7. Watch for loading spinner
8. See success message
9. Modal auto-closes after 2 seconds

**Test Cases:**
- âœ… Upload valid CSV file
- âœ… Try to upload non-CSV file (should show error)
- âœ… Remove selected file
- âœ… Cancel upload
- âœ… Upload without selecting file (button disabled)

### Testing Visual Distinction

1. **Admin View:**
   - Switch to Admin View
   - Visit: Datasets, Researchers, Activity Log
   - Verify **blue banner** appears on each page
   - Text should say "Admin Dashboard"

2. **Researcher View:**
   - Switch to Analyst View  
   - Visit: My Projects
   - Click "Open Workspace" on any project
   - Verify **teal banner** appears on each page
   - Text should say "Researcher Workspace"

## API Integration

### Backend Requirements

Your backend needs to handle:

```python
@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_dataset(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    """
    Upload a CSV dataset
    
    Args:
        file: CSV file from multipart/form-data
        
    Returns:
        {
            "success": true,
            "message": "Dataset uploaded successfully",
            "dataset_id": "abc123"
        }
    """
    # Your upload logic here
    return {"success": True, "message": "Upload successful"}
```

### Error Handling

The frontend expects these error responses:

```json
{
    "message": "Error description here"
}
```

Common errors to handle:
- File too large
- Invalid file format
- Upload failed
- Server error

---

## Configuration

### Default API URL
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
```

### Change API URL

**Option 1:** Environment variable
```bash
# .env
VITE_API_URL=http://your-backend-url:8000
```

**Option 2:** Edit code directly
```javascript
// src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://your-backend-url:8000';
```

## Developer Notes

### Upload Implementation
- Uses `FormData` API for file handling
- Uses `axios` for HTTP requests
- Implements loading states
- Has error boundary for failed uploads
- Auto-resets form after successful upload

### State Management
```javascript
const [uploadFile, setUploadFile] = useState(null);
const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
const [uploadSuccess, setUploadSuccess] = useState(false);
const [uploadError, setUploadError] = useState('');
```

### File Validation
```javascript
if (file.type !== 'text/csv' && !file.name.endsWith('.csv')) {
  setUploadError('Please select a CSV file');
  return;
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements:
- [ ] Multiple file upload
- [ ] Upload progress bar
- [ ] Preview CSV contents before upload
- [ ] Configure epsilon budget during upload
- [ ] Dataset name and description fields
- [ ] Drag-and-drop file handling
- [ ] Upload history/queue
- [ ] Validate CSV structure
- [ ] Show column preview

---

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Button Not Working
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend is running on correct port
- Check CORS settings on backend
- Verify `/upload` endpoint exists

### File Not Uploading
- Check file is actually CSV format
- Verify file size under 100MB
- Check network tab for failed requests
- Verify backend accepts multipart/form-data

### Banners Not Showing
- Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check you're on latest code
- Verify no CSS conflicts

### Colors Look Wrong
- Verify Tailwind is working
- Check browser supports CSS gradients
- Try different browser
