## 🎮 How to Use

### Switch Between User Roles

Open `frontend/src/App.jsx` and change line 11:

```javascript
// For Admin View
const userRole = 'admin';

// For Analyst View
const userRole = 'analyst';
```

Save the file and the app will hot-reload with the new view!

### Navigation

**Admin Mode:**
- Datasets → http://localhost:5173/
- Researchers → http://localhost:5173/researchers
- Activity Log → http://localhost:5173/activity

**Analyst Mode:**
- My Projects → http://localhost:5173/
- Workspace → http://localhost:5173/workspace/:projectId (click "Open Workspace")

## 🎨 Key Features to Test

### Admin Features
1. **Privacy Budget Monitoring**
   - See circular indicators on dataset cards
   - Colors change: Green (60%+), Yellow (30-60%), Red (<30%)

2. **Invite Researcher**
   - Click "+ Invite Researcher" button
   - Fill out form with epsilon budget slider
   - See access levels and dataset selection

3. **Activity Log**
   - View timeline of queries
   - See epsilon costs per query
   - Filter by date, researcher, dataset

### Analyst Features
1. **Query Building**
   - Select query type (count, average, sum, histogram)
   - Choose columns from dropdown
   - Add filters with conditions
   - Adjust epsilon slider (privacy vs accuracy)

2. **Schema Explorer**
   - Expand dataset tree
   - Hover over columns for tooltips
   - See which fields are queryable (✓) vs locked (🔒)

3. **Results Viewing**
   - Execute a query to see results
   - View privacy certificate
   - Check accuracy estimates
   - See remaining budget after query

## 🔧 Configuration

### Mock Data
Edit `src/data/mockData.js` to customize:
- Datasets (3 included)
- Researchers (4 included)
- Schema columns
- Privacy budgets

### Styling
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize:
- Primary color: `#1E40AF`
- Secondary color: `#0D9488`
- Extend theme with new colors

### API Integration
When you have a backend ready:

1. Update `src/services/api.js`:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://your-backend:8000/api';
```

2. The following endpoints are ready:
   - GET `/datasets` - List datasets
   - GET `/researchers` - List researchers
   - POST `/queries/execute` - Execute private query
   - GET `/activity` - Get activity log

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see "Port 5173 is in use", Vite will automatically use 5174 or another port.

### Tailwind Not Working
The app uses Tailwind CSS v4. If styles don't load:
```bash
npm install @tailwindcss/postcss
```

### Hot Reload Not Working
Try:
```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## 📦 Build for Production

```bash
# Create optimized build
npm run build

# The dist/ folder will contain your production files
# Deploy dist/ to any static hosting service
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Connect to Backend
The frontend is ready for a FastAPI backend with these endpoints:
- Dataset management
- Researcher management
- Query execution with DP
- Activity logging

### Add Real DP Library
Integrate with:
- OpenDP (Python)
- Google's DP library
- IBM's diffprivlib

### Enhance Features
- Add authentication
- Real-time query execution
- Data visualization with Recharts
- Budget recommendations
- Query templates

## 📚 Documentation

- See `README.md` for full documentation
- Check component files for inline comments
- Review `services/dpEngine.js` for DP formulas

## 🎯 Demo Tips

1. **Start in Admin Mode** to show dataset management
2. **Invite a researcher** to demonstrate access control
3. **Switch to Analyst Mode** to show the workspace
4. **Build and execute a query** to demonstrate DP
5. **Show the privacy certificate** to explain guarantees
